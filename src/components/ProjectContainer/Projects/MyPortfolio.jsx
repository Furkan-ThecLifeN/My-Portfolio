                  This portfolio was entirely built and designed by me from the
                  ground up. From planning the user experience to implementing
                  each detail in the codebase, I focused on creating a space
                  that not only showcases my capabilities but also reflects my
                  dedication to clean, scalable, and purposeful web development.
