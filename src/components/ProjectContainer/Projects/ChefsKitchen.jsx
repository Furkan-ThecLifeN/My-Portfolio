                <h4>üë®‚Äçüç≥ About the Developer</h4>
                <p>
                  Chef‚Äôs Kitchen was designed and developed entirely by me as a
                  solo project. Every line of code and every design element was
                  handcrafted to simulate a real-world business website. The
                  focus was on delivering a clean and effective frontend
                  solution that‚Äôs both practical and visually appealing.
                  <br />
                  This project also demonstrates my ability to design for real
                  clients ‚Äì aligning brand needs with responsive web
                  technologies and modern UI/UX practices.
                </p>

                  integration with backend services or e-commerce platforms.
