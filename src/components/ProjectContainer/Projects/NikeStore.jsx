                  web application built from scratch using Vite and Vanilla
                  JavaScript. This project delivers a seamless and visually
                  engaging user experience, combining modern UI principles with
                  powerful features such as product filtering, favorite lists,

                    easily save and manage their favorite shoe models. This
                    feature utilizes localStorage, ensuring that users‚Äô
                    selections are preserved across sessions, even after page

                <h4>üëü About the Project</h4>
                <p>
                  Nike Store was conceived and built as a solo project to
                  showcase both frontend development skill and creative design
                  thinking. From UI/UX planning and styling to API structuring
                  and logic implementation, every line of code and visual
                  element was crafted by hand to simulate a real-world
                  e-commerce experience. <br />
                  The creation of a custom data API highlights the flexibility
                  of Vanilla JS and demonstrates the ability to simulate real
                  backend data flow in a frontend-only environment ‚Äî perfect for
                  showcasing technical capability without relying on third-party
                  APIs.
                </p>
